# Java OOP & Data Structures Exercises

This folder is a set of  **Java files** developed as part of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** coursework and **basic data structures and algorithms exercises**.

### Data structures

The repository includes classic linear and non-linear structures, typically implemented in multiple ways (when relevant):

* **Stacks, queues, deques** (array-based and/or linked).
* **Linked lists**.
* **Binary trees** and **binary search trees (BSTs)**.

### Algorithms

The set also covers standard algorithmic techniques often paired with the above structures:

* **Searching**, including **binary search**.
* **Sorting**, including:

  * Bubble sort
  * Insertion sort
  * Heap sort
  * and other comparison-based sorts

### Testing and robustness

Where appropriate, the exercises include:

* Small **test classes** to validate correctness (structure, traversal, search, etc.).
* Explicit **exception handling** (custom exceptions when an operation is invalid).
* Emphasis on **recursive reasoning** for tree-based structures, and on correctness properties (e.g., structural equality, subtree search).
