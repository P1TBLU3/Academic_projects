# Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)

This project is a simple console-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game developed in **Java**.

It was created as a **first-year programming assignment**, intended as a basic practice project to reinforce fundamental programming concepts.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate:

- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Simple data structures (arrays)
- User input handling
- Basic program structure in Java
