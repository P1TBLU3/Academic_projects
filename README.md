# University & Master Projects Archive

This repository gathers **academic projects, labs, and coursework** developed across different years of my **Bachelor’s degree and Master’s program**, recovered from multiple stages and consolidated here into a single technical archive.

The purpose of this repository is to **preserve, organize, and document** the work carried out during my academic training, without implying that all projects share the same level of maturity, complexity, or refactoring.

## 📚 Context and scope

- Projects come from **different courses, subjects, and academic stages** (Bachelor and Master).
- They include **labs, assignments, exercises, and small-to-medium projects**.
- In most cases, the code is kept **close to its original state**, with only minimal changes aimed at:
  - improving readability,
  - adding execution instructions,
  - and clarifying context or purpose.

This repository is **not intended to be production-grade software**, but rather a **structured record of technical learning and progression over time**.
