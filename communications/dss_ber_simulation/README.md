# DSSS BER Simulation

Small MATLAB project simulating a Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) system.

It spreads a binary signal using pseudo-random sequences, transmits it over a noisy channel, and evaluates the bit error rate (BER). The goal is to get hands-on intuition about spreading, despreading, and noise robustness.

University coursework / practice project.
