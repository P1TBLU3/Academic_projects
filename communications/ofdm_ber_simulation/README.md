# OFDM BER Simulation

Small MATLAB project simulating an OFDM system with QAM modulation.

It models transmission over a noisy multipath channel and evaluates the bit error rate (BER) under different conditions. The goal is simply to understand how OFDM behaves in practice and how noise and the channel affect performance.

University coursework / practice project.
